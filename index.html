                    <p>My name is Kevin, and I am 25 years old. I graduated with a B.S. in bioengineering and a minor in computer science and engineering from Lehigh University in 2016. I also graduated with an M.S.E. in bioengineering from the University of Pennsylvania in 2018. Since then, I have been since been searching for a position that combines my passion for contributing to healthcare with my technical knowledge in computer science. As of recently, I have accepted an offer at a Philadelphia startup that specializes in developing software that facilitates discharged hospital patients and post-acute care centers.</p><br>
                    <p>In my spare time, I enjoy both listening to and playing music. I can play guitar comfortably and am currently learning piano. Additionally, I am an avid gamer. My current favorite games are Paladins: Champions of the Realm and Fortnite: Battle Royale. </p>
