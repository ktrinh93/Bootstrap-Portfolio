# Bootstrap-Portfolio

Redone version of "Basic-Porfolio" (https://github.com/ktrinh93/Basic-Portfolio) but done with bootstrap elements/columns, which adds responsiveness for varying screen sizes. Also creates a "mobile" site with header reformatting.

Had an issue where I couldn't figure out how to "wrap text" around my portrait using bootstrap. Seeing as bootstrap uses columns, I was not able to figure out (ie. solve with Google) a way to make the text wrap below my portrait on smaller than medium but larger than sm screen sizes. 

Additionally, at very large screen widths (> 1400px), the content in the About Me page does not fill the content box (white box in center). Attempts to alleviate this at best resulted in only the left side aligning, but an unchangeable margin between the right side of the content and the right edge of the content box. Manually setting certain margins to 0px did not help. For the sake of a balanced appearance, this change was not committed, and the resulting bug is what is submitted/viewable here.
