# Bootstrap-Portfolio

Redone version of "Basic-Porfolio" (https://github.com/ktrinh93/Basic-Portfolio) but done with bootstrap elements/columns, which adds responsiveness for varying screen sizes. Also creates a "mobile" site with header reformatting.

Had an issue where I couldn't figure out how to "wrap text" around my portrait using bootstrap. Seeing as bootstrap uses columns, I was not able to figure out (ie. solve with Google) a way to make the text wrap below my portrait on bigger than medium but less than lg screen sizes.
